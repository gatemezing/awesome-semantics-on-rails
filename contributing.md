# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for contributing to Awesome Semantics on Rails.

## Scope

This list is for knowledge graphs, ontologies, tools, datasets, applications, and events that apply semantic web technology in the railways domain.

## How to add an item

1. Choose the most specific section that fits the item.
2. Add a single bullet using the format `* [Name](URL) - Description.`
3. Keep descriptions short (one sentence), neutral in tone, and free of marketing.
4. Alphabetize entries within each section by the item name.
5. Prefer official or canonical links and avoid URL shorteners.
6. Check for duplicates; if an entry already exists, improve that entry instead.
7. If you add a new section, also update the table of contents.

## Quality bar

- The resource should be publicly accessible.
- The resource should be directly relevant to railways and semantic technologies.
- Links should be stable and point to the primary source when possible.

## Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all project interactions. Harassment and abuse are not tolerated.
