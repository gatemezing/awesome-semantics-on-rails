## Ontologies

### Ontology Implementations

* [ERA Ontology](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/) - ERA ontology covering topology, railway infrastructure and vehicle types. The namespace URI for the ontology is `http://data.europa.eu/949/`


### Academic Papers

* [Rail Topology Ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04378) - Rail Topology Ontology: A Rail Infrastructure Base Ontology.
* 


## Knowledge Graphs

### Sparql Endpoints

* [ERA Endpoint](https://virtuoso.ecdp.tech.ec.europa.eu/sparql) - Sparql Endpoint of the European Union Agency for Railways containing more than 50 million triples of railway infrastructure and vehicle types. 

### SHACL Rules

* [ERA SHACL Rules](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/era-shapes) - ERA SHACL rules used for the ERA KG.

### SKOS Concepts

* [ERA SKOS concepts](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/skos/index.html) - ERA SKOS concepts used for the ERA KG.

## Applications

### Generic Applications

* [Infrastructure Search](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/search) - Searching form of resources in the ERA endpoint.
* [Map Explorer](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/map-explorer) - Visualizing EU railway infrastructure.
* [Route Compatibility Check](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/route-compatibility) - Route compatibility check of vehicle types against railway infrastructure.


### Community Effort


## Conferences
